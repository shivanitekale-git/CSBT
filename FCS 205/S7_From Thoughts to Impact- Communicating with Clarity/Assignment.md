# Assignment: Communicating with Clarity – Structuring Sentences with Details

## Objective  
The objective of this assignment is to help you practice communicating with clarity and specificity. You will apply the concepts of structuring sentences with relevant details (who, what, where, when) to real-life scenarios. This will help improve your communication skills, particularly in interviews and regular conversations, by avoiding vagueness and providing clear, descriptive sentences.

## Guidelines  
- **Duration:** 5-8 minutes (your video should not be too long or too short).  
- **Audio & Video:** Ensure both are ON before starting the recording.  
- **Dress & Grooming:** Dress and groom appropriately for a professional setting.  
- **Background:** Use a neat and clean background. Ideally, a plain wall or tidy space to avoid distractions.  
- **Introduction & Closing:**  
  - Start with a brief introduction (who you are, why this topic is important to you).  
  - Conclude with a closing statement (a quick summary or key takeaway).  
- **Content:** Choose any **three** of the given scenarios and explain how adding specific details improves clarity and understanding.  
- **Deadline:** Submissions after the deadline will not be considered valid.
