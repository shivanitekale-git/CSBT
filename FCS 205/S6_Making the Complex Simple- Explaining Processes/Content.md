## **Step 1: Start with the Purpose**  
### **Content:**  
Define why the process matters – **Why are we doing this?**  

**Example:**

## **Step 2: Prepare the Resources**  
### **Content:**  
Mention tools, documents, or data needed.  

**Example:**  
*"We need the customer requirements document and a tracking sheet to track progress."*  

## **Step 3: Break It Into Steps**  
### **Content:**  
- Always follow a logical order (chronological or priority-based).  
- Use connectors: **First, Next, Then, Finally.**  

**Example:**  
*"First, gather all data inputs. Next, clean and analyze the data. Then, create visual reports. Finally, review insights and present them."*  

## **Step 4: Check for Understanding**  
### **Content:**  
- Pause after key points.  
- Ask questions to check understanding.  

**Example:** *“Let me know if you have any questions. Or, Have you understood?”*  

## **Step 5: End with the Result**  
### **Content:**  
Summarize the outcome or deliverable.  

**Example:**
