## Introduction to Cause and Effect

**Cause:** The reason something happens.  
**Effect:** The result or outcome of that cause.  

### Why It's Important:
- **In interviews:** Explains your reasons for actions.
- **In daily conversations:** Makes explanations clearer.

**Example:**  
- **Cause:** I studied hard.  
- **Effect:** I passed the exam.  
- **Linking words:** because, so, due to, as a result, etc.

## How to Explain Cause

### Common Ways to Explain Cause:
- **Because**  
  *Example:* "I was late because I missed the bus."
- **Due to**  
  *Example:* "The meeting was postponed due to technical issues."
- **Owing to** (More formal)  
  *Example:* "The event was cancelled owing to bad weather."
- **Since**  
  *Example:* "I was tired since I didn’t sleep well last night."
- **As** (More casual)  
  *Example:* "He failed the test as he didn’t study enough."

**Tip:** Mix and match these words for variety and clarity.

## How to Explain Effect

### Common Ways to Explain Effect:
- **So**  
  *Example:* "I missed the bus, so I was late."
- **As a result**  
  *Example:* "She didn’t attend the meeting, as a result, she missed important information."
- **Therefore** (More formal)  
  *Example:* "He didn’t prepare for the interview, therefore he didn’t get the job."
- **Hence** (More formal)  
  *Example:* "The system crashed, hence we had to restart the server."
- **Consequently** (More formal)  
  *Example:* "She missed the deadline, consequently, she lost the contract."

**Tip:** Use "so" for casual conversations, and "therefore" or "consequently" for formal situations.

## Why Cause and Effect Matters in Communication

### In Interviews:
Explains why you did something or why something happened.  
*Example:* "I missed the deadline because I didn’t manage my time well, so I learned to plan my tasks better."

### In Daily Conversations:
Helps explain your actions clearly.  
*Example:* "I bought the laptop due to its great features, so I could work more efficiently."

### In Group Discussions (GD):
Helps explain your point of view logically and convincingly.

## Using ‘Because’ and ‘So’ Together in Sentences

**Example:**  
"I missed the bus because I was late, so I had to take a cab."

**Tip:** Use this combination for a clear sequence of events.

## Introducing ‘Due to’ and ‘As a Result’ for Clearer Explanation

### Example 1:
- "The event was delayed due to the weather."
- "As a result, we had to reschedule the entire program."

### Example 2:
- "The server crashed due to an overload."
- "Consequently, we had to restart the entire system."
